                Hi Phillip,<br> <br>
                In case you don't recognize my name, it's Haley Cooper-Cox, Dale's daughter.
                I had to hunt down your email address which is why you haven't heard from me sooner.
                We are all very sorry to hear about Elmer. My dad, my brother, Casey and I are all heartbroken.
                Your brother has a very special place in our hearts and our lives. I have some pictures I want
                to email you from my wedding (I will have to do that from my computer at home).
                I was truly touched that Elmer made it up hear for that. He helped out tremendously behind the
                scenes too. Casey and I closed on our house the day before our wedding and so my dad and Elmer
                moved our bed in so we could stay there on our wedding night. After the wedding and the reception
                were over and we went to our new house, and of course I had plenty of champagne at the reception,
                but we had no toilet paper for me to go pee. So your brother saved the day. He rode one of my dad's
                motorcycles down to our house in the rain to deliver us toilet paper.
                He would call us often to check in and see how everyone was doing. We were hoping to get him out
                this
                way for Thanksgiving but he was just too busy. He thought he might be able to make it before he
                moved
                back to South Africa.
                We offer our deepest sympathies and our greatest respect. We know how had it is to lose a loved one.
                Elmer is truly loved and will be deeply missed. If you are ever in the country, we would love to see
                you again. You are always a welcome part of our family. <br> <br>
                Take care and much love, <br>
                Haley

            <p>Beste Philip,<br> <br>
                Ons is 'n Suid-Afrikaanse gesin wat in Marokko woonagtig is.
                Eerstens wil ons ons medelye en innige simpatie betuig aan julle almal met hierdie tragiese afsterwe
                van
                Elmer.
                Dit is 'n groot slag en alles het so onverwags gebeur. Aanvaar dus hiermee ons innige meegevoel met
                julle as gesin.
                Alhoewel ons nie vir Elmer geken het nie, het ons steeds 'n baie aangename gesprek met hom gehad aan
                die
                einde van
                Stage 3, net nadat hulle van Nador naby Errachidia (Tilsinnt) geeindig het. Ek het ook enkele fotos
                geneem. Hy was
                baie opgewonde oor sy prestasie en het dadelik sy VSA mederyer geluk gewens met sy mooi prestasie.
                Die volgende oggend het ons hom ook afgesien by die wegspringpunt by Rissani, begin van Stage 4.
                Ek is jammer dat ons nou eers kontak maak, maar, ons het sopas julle webadres aanlyn in die Beeld
                gelees.
                Ek heg hierby die fotos aan. Hoop dit is aangename herinneringe vir julle.
                Laastens wil ek vir julle as gesin baie sterkte toewens in hierdie tyd van rou. Mag ons Hemelse
                Vader
                deur die krag
                van die Heilige Gees, persoonlik by julle elkeen wees. Mag Hy julle vertroos en vir julle Sy rus en
                vrede gee, daardie
                vrede wat ons verstand te bowe gaan. Philippians 4:7 And God's peace, which is far beyond human
                understanding, will keep
                your hearts and minds safe in union with Christ Jesus. Mag die Skrif uit Romeine 8:28 vir jul ook
                versterk:
                Romans 8:28 We know that in all things God works for good with those who love him, those whom he has
                called according to his purpose. <br> <br>
                Baie seen vir julle. <br>

            <p>Dear Phillip, Jualeen and Family. <br> <br>
                As a friend of Elmer I just want to sympathies to you all.
                We all knew he was a great person, and we will miss him a lot.
                But I've peace in my heart and know God needed him much more than we do.
                I know we all ask why Elmer, but we must remember God came to take us
                on our peack time. And I know at that moment Elmer was the happiest person.
                So I hope you will also find peace and understanding. And remember if any
                of you need a helping hand or someone to talk to just let me know. Because
                Elmer would have done the same for me. <br> <br>

            <p> Philip, <br> <br>
                I wanted you to know that I'm thinking about you and your family and that you are
                in my prayers. Elmer was an excellent person and will be sorely missed by all who
                knew him. He had a focus, a drive, and perseverance that I have never known in another
                person. It was inspiring. I feel better for having known him and I know that I'm not
                the only person that he inspired. That is a good legacy to leave behind. It was an
                honor to be his friend as it is to be yours. Know that between Troy and myself you
                always have a home here in America. <br> <br>

            <p>Hi Philip <br> <br>
                My deepest condolences on the death of your brother. I myself race Off Road motorcycles. I had a
                brother
                who raced Off Road
                with me but was unfortunately killed in a Superbike accident 2 years ago, so I have some
                understanding
                of how you must feel.
                Stay strong and remember your brother was and still is a great motivation to a lot of riders out
                there.
                I plan to ride the
                roof this year and will dedicate my finishing this event to Elmer. <br> <br>
                All the best <br>

                Hi, <br> <br>
                I had the pleasure to meet Elmer in Muenster, Texas. He was practicing for the Last Man Standing
                event
                in December, 2006.
                I was riding with some fellow KTM friends and met Elmer and his partner Brian, I believe. We camped
                out
                with them and did
                some trail riding the next day. Elmer was very friendly to me and my wife Christie. I will remember
                him
                and his smile for
                quite some time. I was impressed with his riding skills, but his personality really showed. God
                bless
                the family and friends
                and I hope you will hang on the memories as we all will do. <br> <br>

                To the family of Elmer Symons, <br> <br>
                My name is Candace Weaver, I had the pleasure of meeting Elmer last month at the Red Bull's Last Man
                Standing race in Bulcher , TX.
                Bart Hayes with Powersport Grafx had given him a ride out there, Bart is a friend of ours. After the
                race everyone was at the I-Hop
                getting a bite to eat, and he was talking about racing the Dakar. We are in shock and devastated at
                the
                news. Please know that your
                family are in our prayers. After looking at all the forums, I believe he touched so many lives. I
                know
                that he touched mine and Ken's. <br> <br>

                Philip, <br> <br>
                My name is Christy Warren and I live in Bauxite, Arkansas. My family and I would like to extend our
                thoughts to you at this difficult time. Elmer came
                to Arkansas and did a class and my husband and son attended it. They adored him and have talked of
                him
                everyday since they met him. It means a lot to
                me that he was such a great rider and competitor obviously well on his way to the top and took time
                out
                of his training to help some amateurs learn more
                about riding. He took special time with my son Justin who is 11 and was the only kid at the class
                and
                that really means a lot. Elmer really motivated
                Justin to train hard and have fun too! He just started riding in December of 2005 and he has already
                accomplished so much. He started racing in the
                middle of the series and he ended up placing fourth overall in his class. Justin and my husband
                Scott
                proudly hung their posters Elmer autographed for
                them and they are now even more precious to them than ever. He will forever be an influence in their
                riding and life. It's not every day that you get
                to meet someone who is as nice, special as well as talented as Elmer and I just wanted to let you
                know
                that he will be missed here by many. Our thoughts
                and prayers are with you and your family at this difficult time and we will continue to remember you
                for
                many days to come. <br> <br>
                Sincerely, <br>

                Oh my, he was so happy to be doing this, so grateful to you that you helped him achieve this goal,
                we
                talked about it the day he left the states.
                I am so sad to have lost this friend, I can only imagine the grief you must feel. I keep thinking it
                just can't be true, that there is some horrible mistake.
                If there is anything we can do, can help with, please let Malcolm or Troy or I know.
                We will do our best to help.
                Elmer was such a blessing in my life. He often spoke of the influence you had in making him the man
                he
                was. Thank you for that.
                He is loved and will be sorely missed. <br> <br>

                Philip, <br> <br>
                I am strucken with a loss for words right now. Elmer was a true friend to me and I would have done
                anything for him and without
                a doubt he would return the favor. During the time spent with Elmer I felt like we became pretty
                close.
                I will never forget
                about Elmer and I will continue to tell people of him. Please contact me some how e-mail
                henson618@hotmail.com or phone 864-706-1925 <br> <br>
                Best Regard, <br>

                Dear Philip and Jualeen, <br> <br>
                You dont know me but I am one of the many many people whos life was touched by meeting your Brother.
                I
                am very sad to be writing to you under these
                circumstances and would like to offer you my sincerest, heartfelt apologies for the tragedy that you
                have suffered on this day. The world is a Dakar
                place with the passing of Elmer. He will not be forgotten. My prayers are with Elmer and you all. My
                deepest condolences to you all.
                Elmer was a one of a kind individual. A top notch, class act person. One of the very few people that
                I
                have ever met, who impressed me in such a way.
                He gave his time ad self unselfishly to all who were around him. He took 2 days out of his training
                time
                for Last Man Standing to ride with a bunch
                of no-bodys from Arkansas. That is how I came to know him and how I will always remember him. God
                speed
                my brother. May God be with you all, family and friends. <br> <br>
                Sincerely, <br>
                Chris White

                Hi Philip, <br> <br>
                Firstly I'd like to send my condolences to you and your family. I am really sorry to hear the news
                about
                Elmer.
                I live in the UK and have been here since 1999. Whenever the DAKAR was televised I would often think
                of
                you and Elmer.
                It looks like he really did super well in his career. <br> <br>
                Best wishes. <br>
                Steven Kempson
            </p>

                Dear Philip <br> <br>
                Please accept my deepest sympathy, and know that you are in my prayers. A tragic and shocking loss.
                Elmer was my age and I
                cannot stop thinking about how close to home this feels to me and I have never met him or you.
                I remember looking at Elmer's site last week thinking that I would like to be able to attempt the
                Dakar
                one day too, and
                respecting everything Elmer has achieved.
                Please advise on where the funeral will be, If I cannot be there at least I could spare a moment of
                silence for a real hero. <br> <br>
                Sincerely yours <br>
                Etienne vd Merwe <br>
